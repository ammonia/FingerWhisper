FingerWhisper
=============

Years ago, I read the science fiction YiTai.

The author created a world full of tiny robots that can change sound and images in order to shield 'dangerous' thoughts. So, a new communication method was invented: writting letters on palms, as sence of touch is the only way that robots can not change.

Dozens of people in black hoodies - perhaps there were hundreds - sitting on the ground quietly, holding hands with each other. No one spoke.
...
People sit in a circle. Everyone is connected with another two. Write with your left hand, feel with your right hand.
...
The rule of finger-chat-association is to keep information flow in one direction.

However, I do not believe this complex method works. It calls for perfect cooperation, but can only transfer little information every time. So I wrote the charting room to see what would happen if we chat like this.

This is the simplest version as I have little time to debug. You can see there is even no javascript. Maybe someday I would complish a PC version.
